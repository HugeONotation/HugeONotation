## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hugo.

I'm a hobbyist progammer with interests in C++, graphics, SIMD, and low-level details.

I originally started programming due to a more general interest in computer graphics, but I eventually shifted focus on performance, particularly through leveraging SIMD instructions. More recently, I've become interested in how programming languages can be improved upon to better expose the capabilites of modern CPUs.

I volunteered at CppCon 2024
