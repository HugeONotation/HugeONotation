## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hugo.

I'm a hobbyist progammer with interests in C++, graphics, SIMD, and low-level details.

I originally started programming due to a more general interest in computer graphics, but I eventually shifted focus towards performance, particularly through leveraging SIMD instructions. More recently, I've become interested in how programming languages can better expose the capabilites of modern CPUs.
